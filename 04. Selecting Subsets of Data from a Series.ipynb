It also has the advantage of providing tab-completion help when chaining a method to the end. Place your cursor at the end of the following two lines and press tab. Only the one that selects via dot notation will show the available methods. This helps me remember what methods are possible, so sometimes I will use this to find the method I need and then change the syntax back to the brackets."
