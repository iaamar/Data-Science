    "## Multiple condition expression\n",
    "So far, our boolean selections have involved a single condition. You can have as many conditions as you would like. To do so, you will need to combine your boolean expressions using the three logical operators and, or, and not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use `&`, `|` , `~`\n",
    "Although Python uses the keywords `and`, `or`, and `not`, these will not work when with pandas. You must use the following operators:\n",

    "* `&` for and\n",
    "* `|` for or\n",
    "* `~` for not\n",
