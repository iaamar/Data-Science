    "## pandas dual references: by label and by integer location\n",
    "As previously mentioned, the index of each DataFrame provides a label to reference each individual row. Similarly the columns provide a label to reference each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "What hasn't been mentioned, is that each row and column may be referenced by an integer as well. I call this **integer location**. The integer location begins at 0 and ends at n-1 for each row and column. Take a look above at our sample DataFrame one more time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows with labels **`Aaron`** and **`Dean`** can also be referenced by their respective integer locations 2 and 4. Similarly, the columns **`color`**, **`age`**, and **`height`** can be referenced by their integer locations 1, 3, and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation refers to integer location as **position**. I don't particularly like this terminology as it's not as explicit as integer location. The key term here is INTEGER.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the difference between indexing and selecting subsets of data?\n",
    "The documentation uses the term **indexing** frequently. This term is essentially just a one-word phrase to say **subset selection**. I prefer the term subset selection as, again, it is more descriptive of what is actually happening. Indexing is also the term used in the official Python documentation (for selecting subsets of lists or strings for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The three indexers `[ ]`, `loc`, `iloc`\n",
    "pandas provides three **indexers** to select subsets of data. An indexer is a term for one of  `[ ]`, `loc`, or `iloc` and what makes the subset selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go in-depth on how to make selections with each of these indexers. Each indexer has different rules for how it works. All our selections will look similar to the following, except they will have something placed within the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> df[]\n",
    ">>> df.loc[]\n",
    ">>> df.iloc[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "When the brackets are placed directly after the DataFrame, the term **just the brackets** will be used to differentiate them from the brackets after **`loc`** and **`iloc`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Begin with *just the brackets*\n",
    "As we saw in the last notebook, just the brackets are used to select a single column as a Series. We place the column name inside the brackets to return the Series. Let's read in a simple, small DataFrame and select a single column."
